              <h2>The Locked Door</h2>
              <h4>Freida McFadden </h4>
              <p>While eleven-year-old Nora Davis was up in her bedroom doing homework, she had no idea her father was killing women in the basement.
                Until the day the police arrived at their front door.
                Decades later, Nora's father is spending his life behind bars, and Nora is a successful surgeon with a quiet, solitary existence. Nobody knows her father was a notorious serial killer. And she intends to keep it that way.
                Then Nora discovers one of her young female patients has been murdered. In the same unique and horrific manner that her father used to kill his victims.
                Somebody knows who Nora is. Somebody wants her to take the fall for this unthinkable crime. But she's not a killer like her father. The police can't pin anything on her.</p>

              <h2>That Night</h2>
              <h4>Nidhi Upadhyay </h4>
              <p>Natasha, Riya, Anjali and Katherine were best friends in college - each different from the other yet inseparable - until that night.
                It was the night that began with a bottle of whisky and a game of Ouija but ended with the death of Sania, their unlikeable hostel mate. The friends vowed never to discuss that fateful night, a pact that had kept their friendship and guilt dormant for the last twenty years.
                But now, someone has begun to mess with them, threatening to reveal the truth that only Sania knew. Is it a hacker playing on their guilt or has Sania's ghost really returned to avenge her death?
                As the faceless enemy closes in on them, the friends come together once again to recount what really happened that night. But when the story is retold by each of them, the pieces don't fit. Because none of them is telling the whole truth . . .
                That Night is a dark, twisted tale of friendship and betrayal that draws you in and confounds you at every turn.</p>
